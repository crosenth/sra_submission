SAMN04859440	PRJNA319051	S5	j47tr4	DNA was extracted using the Bacteremia Kit (Mobio). The V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was targeted for broad-range PCR with pyrosequencing. 6-bp barcodes were used with the reverse primer to facilitate multiplexing. Reactions were purified using Agencourt AMPure beads prior to sequencing.	AMPLICON	METAGENOMIC	PCR	single	_LS454	454 GS FLX Titanium	fastq	j47tr4.fastq.bz2
