			28S and ITS2 region amplicon of human vaginal metagenome: vaginal fluid	AMPLICON	METAGENOMIC	PCR	paired	ILLUMINA	Illumina MiSeq	DNA was extracted using the Bacteremia DNA isolation Kit (MoBio). The 28S and ITS2 region of the fungal rRNA operon was targeted for broad-range PCR with Illumina MiSeq sequencing for characterizing the fungal biota. Nextera XT Index kits v2 (Illumina) were used to facilitate multiplexing. Reactions were purified using Agencourt AMPure beads prior to sequencing.	fastq
