			AMPLICON	METAGENOMIC	PCR	paired	ILLUMINA	Illumina MiSeq	DNA was extracted using the QIAamp UCP Pathogen Mini Kit (Qiagen) with mechanical disruption of samples using 1.4-mm ceramic beads followed by enzymatic lysis via proteinase K.  The v1-V2 region of the 16S rRNA gene was targeted for broad-range PCR with Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Reactions were purified using Agencourt AMPure beads prior to sequencing.	fastq
