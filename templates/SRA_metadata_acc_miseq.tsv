			16S rRNA V3-V4 region amplicon of human vaginal metagenome: vaginal fluid	AMPLICON	METAGENOMIC	PCR	paired	ILLUMINA	Illumina MiSeq	DNA was extracted using the Bacteremia DNA isolation Kit (MoBio). The V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was targeted for broad-range PCR with Illumina MiSeq sequencing. NexteraÂ® XT Index kits v2 (Illumina) were used to facilitate multiplexing. Reactions were purified using Agencourt AMPure beads prior to sequencing.	fastq
